            <div><p>The idea for Pinterest emerged from an earlier app created by Ben Silberman and Paul Sciarra called Tote[10] 
                which served as a virtual replacement for paper catalogs. Tote struggled as a business, significantly due to
                 difficulties with mobile payments. At the time, mobile payment technology was not sophisticated enough to enable
                  easy on-the-go transactions, inhibiting users from making many purchases via the app. Tote users however were
                   amassing large collections of favorite items and sharing them with other users. The behavior struck a chord with
                    Silberman, and he shifted the company to building Pinterest, 
                which allowed users to create collections of a variety of items and share them with each other.[11]</p></div>

            <p>The development of Pinterest began in December 2009, 
                and the site launched the prototype as a closed beta
                 in March 2010. Nine months after the launch, the 
                 website had 10,000 users. Silbermann said he wrote
                   to the first 5,000 users, offering his phone number
                   and even meeting with some of them.[12] The launch 
                   of an iPhone app in early March 2011 brought in more 
                   downloads than expected.[13] This was followed by an 
                   iPad app[14] and Pinterest Mobile, a version of the 
                   website for non-iPhone users.[15] Silbermann and a few 
                   programmers operated the site out of a small apartment 
                   until the summer of 2011.[12]

                    Pinterest grew rapidly during this period. On August 10, 
                    2011, Time magazine listed Pinterest in its "50 Best Websites 
                    of 2011" article.[16] In December 2011, the site became one of 
                    the top 10 largest social network services, according to Hitwise
                    data, with 11 million total visits per week.[17] Pinterest won
                    the Best New Startup of 2011 at the TechCrunch Crunchies Awards.
                    [18][19] For January 2012, comScore reported the site had 11.7 million 
                    unique U.S. visitors, making it the fastest site ever to break through 
                    the 10 million unique visitor mark.[20] At the 2012 Webby Awards, Pinterest 
                    won Best Social Media App and People's Voice Award for best functioning visual 
                    design.[21]</p>
